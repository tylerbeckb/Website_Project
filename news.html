      <h2>Amazon Road</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Brazil are going to pave a road that goes straight through the Amazon rainforest. Researches 
        say that this road will cause further deforestation to the Amazon, destroying the ecosystem. 
        The paved road will help with connecting Brazils areas however, deforestation will increase 
        dramaticly as its easier to get machines to the rainforest.
        <br><br>
        This area is one of the Amazons most untouched areas, with the introduction into better road 
        quality the area will not be as untouched as trees will need to get cleared for the road to 
        get paved.
