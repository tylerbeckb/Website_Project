      <h2>Amazon Road</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Brazil are going to pave a road that goes straight through the Amazon rainforest. Researches 
        say that this road will cause further deforestation to the Amazon, destroying the ecosystem. 
        The paved road will help with connecting Brazils areas however, deforestation will increase 
        dramaticly as its easier to get machines to the rainforest.
        <br><br>
        This area is one of the Amazons most untouched areas, with the introduction into better road 
        quality the area will not be as untouched as trees will need to get cleared for the road to 
        get paved.

      <h2>Amazon Degragation</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        The guardian has reported that a third of the Amazon rainforest is being degraded by droughts and human causes. 
        Droughts are causing water shortages across the rainforest making the trees more fammable and prone to 
        forest fires. Furthermore, it stops new plants from growing which would replenish biodiversity
        <br><br>
        Human causes like logging is destroying the Amazon increasingly reducing the capacity to store carbon. 
        This needs to slow down as the guardian states that 17% of the rainforest has been lost in the past 
        century. 
        <br><br>
        This information has been a summary from (guardian, 2023)
