      <!--Amazon Road-->
      <h2>Amazon Road</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Brazil are going to pave a road that goes straight through the Amazon rainforest. Researches 
        say that this road will cause further deforestation to the Amazon, destroying the ecosystem. 
        The paved road will help with connecting Brazils areas however, deforestation will increase 
        dramaticly as its easier to get machines to the rainforest.
        <br><br>
        This area is one of the Amazons most untouched areas, with the introduction into better road 
        quality the area will not be as untouched as trees will need to get cleared for the road to 
        get paved.

      <!--Amazon Degragation-->
      <h2>Amazon Degragation</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        The guardian has reported that a third of the Amazon rainforest is being degraded by droughts and human causes. 
        Droughts are causing water shortages across the rainforest making the trees more fammable and prone to 
        forest fires. Furthermore, it stops new plants from growing which would replenish biodiversity
        <br><br>
        Human causes like logging is destroying the Amazon increasingly reducing the capacity to store carbon. 
        This needs to slow down as the guardian states that 17% of the rainforest has been lost in the past 
        century. 
        <br><br>
        This information has been a summary from (guardian, 2023)

      <!--Goods Ban-->
      <h2>Goods Ban</h2>
      <br>
      <p>BBC has reported that goods that are a product of deforestation will not get sold in the EU. It includes 
        products that include palm oil and some furniture that was created by logging. This is a significant 
        development has it would reduce the demand for products that require deforestation therefore, reducing 
        the amount of carbon dioxide being released. There will to checks to mke sure that companies selling 
        to the EU is following this regulation.
        <br><br>
        This has been a summary from (BBC, 2022)

      <!--COP26-->
      <h2>COP26</h2>
      <br>
      <p>BBC reported that world leaders want to end deforestation by 2030 which comes with over 14 billion pounds  
        of funds to meet this objective. Some countries will also stop the import of palm oil that come from 
        deforestation. BBC has stated that the countries pledged has 85% of a forest cover in the world.
        <br><br>
        Even through forest loss is slowly reducing there is still a overall lost of cover which will continue.
        Industries are driven by the demand for beef and timber so the pledge if followed will stop the destruction 
        of all forests including the Amazon.
