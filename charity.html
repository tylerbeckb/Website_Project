          Cool Earth charity aims to protect as most of the forest as possible to try to reduce deforestation.
          They also give money to the indigenous people of the rainforest to stop illegal logging and to protect the 
          forest. They have saved over 177 million tonnes of carbon to be released into the atmosphere.
          <br><br>
          They use many solutions to this problem for example: wildfire prevention; carbon capturing; forest monitoring.
          Forest monitoring is the act of finding trends and patterns in data and making them accessible to everyone.
