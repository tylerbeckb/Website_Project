            Cool Earth charity aims to protect as most of the forest as possible to try to reduce deforestation.
            They also give money to the indigenous people of the rainforest to stop illegal logging and to protect the 
            forest. They have saved over 177 million tonnes of carbon to be released into the atmosphere.
            <br><br>
            They use many solutions to this problem for example: wildfire prevention; carbon capturing; forest monitoring.
            Forest monitoring is the act of finding trends and patterns in data and making them accessible to everyone.

          <p>
            WWF aims to protect everything in the ecosystem and try to regenerate nature wherever it is damaged. Some of 
            their projects are: protesting <span class="key_word">fossil fuels</span>; making sustainable food; limiting 
            the destruction of forests. Try to build a sustainble future for humanity by tackling climate change and 
            global hunger. One of their main achievments is restoring 1.2 milllion seagrass in the UK which benefits the 
            ocean health dramatically. 
            <br><br>
            To help with their goal you can donate directly to them or adopt an endangered animal. Moreover, you can 
            become a member and be able volunteer. This is a summary of (WWF.2023) and you can find out more by clicking
