          <h2>UK Deforestation</h2>
          <br>
          <p><span class="key_word">Deforestation</span> still takes place in the UK as the government is not protecting the forests
            therefore <span class="key_word">logging</span> can take place which is destroying the ecosystem. Replanting of trees in forests 
            is not enough to be greater than trees being cut down. Even with replanting trees they will take 
            decades to make an impact in <span class="key_word">climate change</span>.
             <br><br> 
             Since 2001 England overall has seen a decrease in forest cover by 6% and Scotland has seen
             a 20% decrease in forest cover (Global forest Watch, 2022). Increasingly, this will not suddenly
             change as the UK population keeps growing, the demand for resources and food will grow with it.
             This is cause more <span class="key_word">deforestation</span> unless the correct legsilatioin get put in place.
          </p>

          <h2>UK Reforestation</h2>
          <br>
          <p><dfn>Reforestation</dfn><cite> - In locations affected by distrubtions it is an act of replanting trees </cite>
            (OneTreePlanted. 2022)
            <br><br>
            <span class="key_word">Reforestation</span> is dramaticly increasing in the UK with the target of keeping 12% of the UK forested by 2050
             (National Audit Office). This will help with the decrease of forest cover in the past 20 years as old areas 
             are becoming mineral rich and biodiversity will be on the increase. Reduction in CO2 from the UKs atmosphere
             will have a positive effect of peoples lives as air quailty will increase therefore reducing health problems.
