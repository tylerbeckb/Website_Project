        <h2>UK Deforestation</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Deforestation still takes place in the UK as the government is not protecting the forests
            therefore logging can take place which is destroying the ecosystem. Replanting of trees in forests 
            is not enough to be greater than trees being cut down. Even with replanting trees they will take 
            decades to make an impact in climate change.
             <br><br> 
             Since 2001 England overall has seen a decrease in forest cover by 6% and Scotland has seen
             a 20% decrease in forest cover (Global forest Watch, 2022). Increasingly, this will not suddenly
             change as the UK population keeps growing, the demand for resources and food will grow with it.
             This is cause more deforestation unless the correct legsilatioin get put in place.
