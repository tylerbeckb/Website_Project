      <p class="col_60">
        Sumatra rainforest is one of the most rapidly deforested places on the planet due to illegal logging and 
        not enough funding to help stop it. Indonesia contribute over a 3rd of global carbon emissions from deforestation.
        Palm oil plantations are being fuelled by demand which contributes heavily to Indonesian deforestation. 50 
        million people live in the forest and rely on it to survive. However, with the shift to destroying the forest 
        many are straving or forced to leave their home as nature gets burnt around them.

        The Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world with it having over a 10th of all known species in the world.
        It is threaten by illegal resource overextraction, for example, logging and over fishing. These are unsustainable
        and will cause the collapse of the ecosystem. A major threat is forest fires, with it releasing tons of CO2, it 
        increases the intensisty of future fires. These are major threats that are affecting the people and biodiveristy 
        Over 40 million people rely on the amazon and so does the world to prevent a climate crisis.

        <p>
          Jaguars are nearly threatherd in the amazon. They're found most in the amazon. However due to the rapid decline 
          in the amazon, the population is decreasing Illegal trade is hurting the population further withn not enough aid
          to counteract this activity. <br><br> To help you can adopt a jaguar with WWF. Every month a payment will be 
          made which is cruical in the survial of the species.

        <p>
          A major threat to these animals is habitat loss as they live in trees. They are an important part of the 
          balanced ecosystem. They don't move very fast so can't get away from danger. Their population is directly 
          correlated to the health of the rainforest. <br><br> You can help by donating at WWF or adopting one, which 
          will keep them at a stable population.

        <p class="col_60">
          This is the 2nd largest rainforest and provides 75 million people with natural resourses and a way of life. it is 
          rich with resourses but this is what is causing the downfall. Demand for these resources increase which is causing 
          more extraction, this destorys the ecosystem. The wildlife that lives in the rainforest is being illegally traded 
          which leaves some parts of the rainforest empty of life. Agriculture is a main driver of deforestation in the 
          Congo. The Congo id home to many species of Gorillas and elephants with declining populations.
