          <br>
          <p>Help by either planting or donating money to a charity that will plant a tree for you.
            This will help as the tree you planted will absorb CO2 to produce oxygen. It is the most 
            simple but effective way that you can do it home. You can make it a community activity,
            then the whole community can plant a tree which would make a real difference.
            <br><br>

          <!-- Education -->
          <h2>Educate People</h2>
          <br>
          <p>Educating people about the impacts of deforestation will help raise awareness of this 
            major issue. This will increase the chance action will take place due too as an increasingly
            amount of people will be putting pressure on governments to act. 
            <br><br>
            Education can create a multiplier effect where if you educate one person they might educate 
            another which will get more people to act to help stop deforestation.
