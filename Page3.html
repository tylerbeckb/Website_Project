          <h2>Plant Trees</h2>
          <br>
          <p>Help by either planting or donating money to a charity that will plant a tree for you.
            This will help as the tree you planted will absorb CO2 to produce oxygen. It is the most 
            simple but effective way that you can do it home. You can make it a community activity,
            then the whole community can plant a tree which would make a real difference.
            <br><br>
            There are mulitple charities that you cann plant a tree with like the national trust. 
            To donate search 'plant a tree' into google to press the button below to go straight 
            to the national trust donation page.

          <!-- Reduce meat intake -->
          <h2>Reduce Meat Intake</h2>
          <br>
          <p>The consumption of significant amount of meat fuels the act of <span class="key_word">deforestation</span> as cattle 
            ranching is one of the main drivers as animals like cows need a lot of space. Global demand 
            keeps increasing causing more forests being cut down for space.
            <br><br>
            You don't have to stop eating meat entirely however, reducing meat intake by half or even a 
            third will help reduce the demand for meat if more and more people take this opportunity.

          <h2>Recycle</h2>
          <br>
          <p>The act of <span class="key_word">recycling</span> everyday makes a big impact and creates many benefits. Recycling wood 
            and paper will reduce the demand therefore reducing the amount of logging taking place. 
            <br><br>
            Buying recycled products will also produce the same effect and it also helps support those
            companies and charities fighting to save <span class="key_word">deforestation</span>. It reduces the amount of waste going 
            to landfills. There are labels on products that informs you if they have been reycled so 
            next time you got shopping look out for the sticker.

          <!-- Education -->
          <h2>Educate People</h2>
          <br>
          <p>Educating people about the impacts of <span class="key_word">deforestation</span> will help raise awareness of this 
            major issue. This will increase the chance action will take place due too as an increasingly
            amount of people will be putting pressure on governments to act. 
            <br><br>
            Education can create a multiplier effect where if you educate one person they might educate 
            another which will get more people to act.

          <!-- Palm Oil -->
          <h2>Don't Buy Palm Oil Products</h2>
          <br>
          <p><span class="key_word">Palm oil</span> has become a significant cause of degradgation of rainforests as areas are being 
            cleared for plantations. 17% of Malaysia forests were lost between 2002-2020 due to palm oil 
            plantations (Bloomberg UK. 2021). As palm oil demand keeps increasing, <span class="key_word">deforestation</span> will keep 
            taking place.
            <br><br>
            <span class="key_word">Palm oil</span> is in loads of products for example: chocolate; soap; ice cream; shampoo and many more (WWWF).
            We need to raise awareness and you can help my looking for palm oil free logo on the back of products 
            so you can make sure you're not contributing to the destruction of trees.
